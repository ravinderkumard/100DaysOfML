Types of ML
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Semi-Supervised Learning

Learning based upon Data instead of writing lot of conditional statements.
Supervised Learning:
    Regression : If target value is numerical so tha tis regression problem
    Classification: if target data is categorical so that is classifcaiton problem

Unsupervised Learning: (It generally don't have output so the action should be taken based upon input data only)
    Clustering - put data into segments/groups based upon the input data
    Dimensionality Reduction -  
    Anomaly Detection
    Assosication rule learning
